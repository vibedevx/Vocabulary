# Vocabulary Collector Edge Extension

This extension adds a context menu to save selected text into a vocabulary list. Clicking the extension icon opens a sidebar that displays the saved words with buttons to pronounce, edit, or remove each entry. A separate tab lets you look up dictionary definitions with text-to-speech pronunciation. The sidebar follows Edge's light or dark theme automatically, and you can launch a full-page *Study Mode* tab to practice your vocabulary.
